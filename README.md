# Simple shortest path application

A simple application implements Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path between two coordinates (as the crow flies) from list of coordinates

## Usage
- Go to https://tdloi.github.io/simple-shortest-path
- Input a list of coordinates, each line contains three value: coordinate names, latitude and lontitude. If radius is not resented, a random value will be generated. This radius value is used for determining adjacent vertices, vertices within radius of a vertex will become its adjacent vertex.
