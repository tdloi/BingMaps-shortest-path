# Simple shortest path application

A simple application implements Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path between two coordinates (as the crow flies) from list of coordinates

## Usage
- Go to https://tdloi.github.io/simple-shortest-path
- Input a list of coordinates, with two coordinates on each row, each coordinate includes latitude and lontitude seperate by a space (or on each column if load from csv files)
